This is and sheet conversion from a pdf to html using online pdf converter.

The css and html is split in two files, and text input have been added to a few spots, that's about it.
As it this a conversion the classes, formatting, or basicly everything, is horribly done with no sensible naming convention as it is computergenerated.
It might even be smarter to start from scratch, pull together the right amount of tables with input fields, add values were to save the sheet data and use Roll20's column classes for formatting.

I might continue with this at some later point, but anyone is free to try make changes to this.
